1. redo all documentation according to Google Python Style
https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

2. refactor ERROR and verbose output into own functions (maybe an IO module?)

3. try to refactor other functions into their own modules

4. do long overdue testing

5. attempt TODOs

6. implement installation and pipi

for later, the dependences we have are:
bash

ffmpeg
