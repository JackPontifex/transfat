1. Refactor error and runtime output into functions.
2. Try seeing if we can split up the main script into several modules.
3. Do (long overdue) testing.
4. Work on improvements marked with __TODO__.
5. Make the program installable (using pipi?)
6. Think of a better name more specific to what the program does.

For reference, the external programs we're using are:
- bash
- fatsort
- ffmpeg
