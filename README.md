# trans-fat

## Purpose
trans-fat's purpose is to make playing music files on your car stereo over USB not a total nightmare. Some car stereos play audio files from a USB stick in the order that the files were transfered to the deviceâ€”which is in general not alphanumeric order. This means that when you put on an album, it might start from track 6, then go to track 9 or something, and, man, is that ever annoying. To make things worse, many of these devices demand that your audio files be either mp3s or wmas; so say good-bye to your FLACs and oggs.

No! I will not say good-bye to sane file ordering and I will not say goodbye to my FLACs and oggs, thank you: I will use <strong>trans-fat</strong> to transfer files to my FAT device! (Oh, did I mention, those car stereos only accept FAT devices.)

## What does this do?

Say we run

```
$ trans-fat source drive/destination
```

then <strong>trans-fat</strong> does some/all of the following:

1. Filter out any unwanted .logs, .cues., etc. in source
2. Convert non-mp3s to temporary mp3
3. Transfer files to the destination
4. Sort the drive into alphanumeric order
5. Unmount & clean-up

## Great, how do I install this?
