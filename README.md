# trans-fat

## Purpose
trans-fat's purpose is to make playing music files on your car stereo over USB not a total nightmare. Some car stereos play audio files from a (FAT-only) USB stick in the order that the files were transfered to the deviceâ€”which is in general not alphanumeric order. This means that when you put on an album, it might start from track 6, then go to track 9 or something. To make things worse, many of these devices demand that your audio files be either MP3s or WMAs; so say good-bye to your FLACs and Oggs.

<strong>trans-fat</strong> transfers audio files to a FAT device and worries about these details so you don't have to.

## What does this do?

Say we run

```
$ trans-fat source drive/destination
```

then <strong>trans-fat</strong> does some/all of the following:

1. Filter out any unwanted .logs, .cues, etc. in source
2. Convert non-MP3s to temporary MP3s
3. Transfer files to the destination
4. Sort the drive into alphanumeric order
5. Unmount & clean-up

## Great, how do I install this?

First you need to get some dependencies. Assuming you're on Debian (or similar) run
```
sudo apt-get install fatsort ffmpeg
```
then to install trans-fat run
```
sudo pip3 install trans-fat
```
