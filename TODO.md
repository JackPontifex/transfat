For module stuff:
- [x] work on documentation
- [ ] create functions for verbose, aborting, error
- [ ] make functions of a few of the things that main.py does itself
- [ ] according to Google we should have a main fn and only call that for
  self-test code


1. Do (long overdue) testing.
2. Work on improvements marked with __TODO__.
3. Make the program installable (using pipi?)
4. Think of a better name more specific to what the program does.

For reference, the external programs we're using are:
- bash
- fatsort
- ffmpeg
